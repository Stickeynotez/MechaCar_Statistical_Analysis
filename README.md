# MechaCar_AutosRUs_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to review data from MechaCar projects for analysis on what can be changed to improve the MechaCar Project. 
This project includes:
- Performance of multiple linear regression models to identify variables that predict gas mileage on a MechaCar project.
- T-tests  to determine if the suspension coils used are effective
- Summary statistics on suspension coils

1. The variables picutred that show a statistically non-random amount of variance are the Vehicle Length, and the Ground Clearance of the vehicle. These have a p-value less than 0.05 - this is the normal significance level, anything above is statistically insignificant.

2. The p-value for this model is shown to be 5.25e-11, far less than the normal significance level, indicating that the slope will not be zero.

3. The r-squared value is 0.7149 which shows 71.5% of predictions (overall) would be determinable. This is an effective prediction tool.
